/// A collection of resources that can be accessed by external effects.
///
/// This is used to pass resources to external effects while properly scoping the resource to the running stage graph.
/// If you want to share a resource across multiple stage graphs, you can use `Arc<Mutex<T>>` or similar.
///
/// ## API Design Choices
///
/// StageGraph supports single-threaded simulation as well as multi-threaded production code.
/// Since effect implementations must cover both cases with the same code, the resulting API must
/// be constrained by both environments. The simulation can easily provided a `&mut Resources`,
/// but if we require that, then the production code will have to hold a lock on the `Resources`
/// for the whole duration of each effect, serializing all resources.
///
/// Therefore, even though not needed in simulation, we design the API so that the effect can
/// use its resources for shorter durations.
///
/// ## `Sync` Bound
///
/// In order to allow resources to be used without blocking the whole resource collection, shared
/// references can be obtained with read locking. Since this fundamentally allows shared access
/// from multiple threads, the resources must be `Sync`. If your resource is not `Sync`, you can
/// use [`SyncWrapper`](https://docs.rs/sync_wrapper/latest/sync_wrapper/struct.SyncWrapper.html)
/// or a mutex.
