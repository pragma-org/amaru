/// This benchmark generates a large random header tree and a long sequence of actions
/// (adding headers from random peers and rollbacks) to be executed on a `HeadersTree`.
/// It then measures the average time taken to execute each action.
///
/// Run with: `cargo bench --bench headers_tree --features="test-utils profiling"`
///
/// Note: profiling requires `pprof` to be installed and only works on Unix systems.
/// If you run with profiling enabled, a flamegraph file named 'headers-tree-flamegraph.svg'
/// will be generated in the current directory. You can open it with a web browser and check which
/// functions are taking the most time.
///
/// This way of profiling was chosen to be able to isolate exactly the code we want to benchmark
/// and not the generation of the tree and actions.
