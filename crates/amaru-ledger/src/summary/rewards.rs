This module implements the formulas and data structures necessary for rewards and incentives
calculations.

Stakeholders on Cardano can delegate their stake to registered pools, run private pools, or opt
out of the protocol. Non-participation excludes their stake from rewards. Incentives are
primarily monetary, with rewards paid in Ada, aligning financial interests with protocol
adherence to foster a stable, desirable system state.

Rewards are distributed per epoch, drawn from monetary expansion and transaction fees, with a
delay.

Rewards are shared among stake pools based on their contributions, with key refinements to
ensure fairness:

- Rewards are capped for overly large (i.e. saturated) pools to prevent centralization.
- Rewards decrease if pool operators fail to create required blocks as expected.
- Pool operators are compensated via declared costs and margins, with the remainder distributed
  to members.
- Pools with higher owner pledges receive slightly higher rewards, discouraging Sybil attacks
  and stake splitting.

To mitigate chaotic behavior from short-sighted decisions, the system calculates non-myopic
rewards. Wallets rank pools by these rewards, guiding stakeholders toward long-term optimal
behavior. The system stabilizes in a Nash Equilibrium, ensuring no stakeholder has incentive to
deviate from the optimal strategy.

Rewards are calculated and distributed automatically after each epoch, but comes with a delay.

Since Ouroboros is an epoch-based consensus using stake distribution as weight in the (private)
random leader-election procedure, it requires a _stable stake distribution_ to ensure
consistency across leaders. Hence, the stake distribution is considered fixed when an epoch is
over. Changing stake in epoch `e` will only have an effect on the leader schedule in epoch `e + 1`.

Therefore, stake movements on epoch `e` only earns rewards during the calculation in epoch `e + 2`
(since the rewards calculation requires to evaluate the performances of a pool in the previous
epoch).

In addition, given the time needed to compute rewards very much exceeds the computing budget
that a node has an epoch boundary, the calculation is typically done incrementally or spread
during the epoch. This implies that rewards are only distributed on _the next epoch boundary_,
and thus available for withdrawal only in `e + 3`.

Here below is a diagram showing this lifecycle. Note that while step are outline at different
moment from the perspective of the stake movement in epoch `e`, each step is in fact done for
each epoch (related to different snapshots) since it is a continuous cycle.

[^1]: Technically, we need to wait a few slots for the snapshot (e + 1) to stabilise; otherwise
we risk doing an expensive computation which may be rolled back. In practice, the calculation
only starts after 2*k blocks into (e + 2) though conceptually, it boils down to the same thing.

The portions in dotted plots materializes the work done by the ledger at an epoch boundary,
whether the work is considered in the previous epoch or the next depends on what side of the
timeline it is.

- When it appears on the left-hand side, we will say that the computation happens _at the end
  of the epoch_ (once every block for that epoch has been processed, and before any blocks for
  the next epoch is).

- When it appears on the right-hand side, we will say that the computation happens _at the
  beginning of the epoch_ (before any block is ever produced).

The distinction is useful when thinking in terms of snapshots. A snapshot captures the state of
the system at a certain point in time. We always take snapshots _at the end of epochs_, before
certain mutations are applied to the system.

    // looking at the ledger state right after the 'SNAP' rule.
    //
    // The 'rewards' snapshots contains data pertaining to the rewards of a particular epoch. Those
    // rewards are calculated *later*, which makes some element of the snapshot a bit tricky to anchor
    // in time.
    //
    // In particular, the treasury and reserves value used for rewards calculation are the values of
    // the pots *at the moment the calculation begin*.
    //
    // So, for rewards corresponding to an epoch `e`, these calculation begin about `k` blocks within
    // epoch `e + 3`; and are paid out in the transition from `e + 3` to `e + 4` (and thus, available
    // in `e + 4`).
    //
    // BUT: for the 'rewards' snapshot at epoch `e`, we pull the treasury value from our snapshots at
    // `e + 2`; which already includes rewards paid out to accounts as well as the leftovers from any
    // unregistered account, but, does not include leftovers that may come from pool retirements since
    // those are only process _at the beginning of epochs_ (and thus, after the snapshot has been
    // taken).
    //
    // For example, there's a pool retiring in the transition from 176 to 177, with a reward account
    // that's already unregistered. And thus, the deposit is sent back to the treasury. So when the
    // rewards calculation for 174 kicks in later in the epoch, the deposit was already added to the
    // treasury... So it won't be present from our snapshot labeled 176 since it happened BEFORE the
    // beginning of the epoch 177.
