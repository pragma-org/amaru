                        Whoops! The Amaru process panicked, rather than handling the error it encountered gracefully.

                        This is almost certainly a bug, and we'd appreciate a report so we can improve Amaru.

                        Please report this error at https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/issues/new.

                        that produced it.
