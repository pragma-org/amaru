# What & How Can You Contribute?

## Code

We are still early code-wise so it is a bit hard to provide any guidance here.
We will adjust and amend these instructions as soon as we feel ready to welcome
contributions from that side.

## Other

There are various peripheral activities that are useful and welcome
contributions. If you're willing to contribute but don't know what and where to
start, here's a non-exhaustive list of ideas:

1. Use the software! Build projects and products with it, and tell us about it.
   In particular, <u><strong>if you are a stake pool operator</strong></u>, please reach out to be
   involved in the upcoming testnet and further development updates.

1. Identify and report defects. Notice anything that seems off? Let us know.

1. Propose features and ideas, backed by use-cases and examples.[^1]

1. Attend demos, delivery events and project pulse happening at a regular cadence.

1. Write tutorials, guides and/or record educational videos to help others with the project.

1. Proof-read and review documents for technical accuracy and understanding.

[^1]: A good feature request should mention a use-cases and a few personas, as well as the context in which that features is envisioned. Note that we are more interested in _problems_ than _solutions_. Often, a single solution for one group may not be ideal for another. But understanding what problem each group is trying to solve is crucial for designing the right solution.
