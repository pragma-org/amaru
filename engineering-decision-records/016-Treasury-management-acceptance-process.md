# Treasury management & Acceptance process

## Context

This decision record documents the process behind managing the payments linked to the treasury budget.

## Motivation

We want to have a very straightforward approach to managing the treasury budget we receive and the acceptance of deliverables made on the project. 

Thus, we would like to track and report activity monthly in a very simple manner to have a transparent and cohenrent treasury management process. 

We would also like to use lessons learned and best practices from other industries and take a minimalistic approach of finance management on a project.

## Decision

### Acceptance process

- Every scope of work bound by a contract on the project shall be subject to the acceptance process mentionned here.

- The acceptance process is deemed finished when the scope owner (accountable of the work done) updates the [amaru-treasury Journal](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/tree/main/journal) with an entry stating that he accepts the work done.

- The content of said acceptance has to describe the extent of the work done by linking Pull Requests, linking documentation or any other piece of evidence that can serve as material.

- Once the work has been deemed acceptable, the contributor has to generate an invoice to "Amaru Maintainer Committee" "Dammstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland" that mentions the scope and the work accomplished and send it via email with as Cc: Laura Dugan <laura@cag.xyz> and Damien Czapla <damien.czapla@openthelead.com>.

- By receiving this invoice, the scope owner will do a `disburse` and the various proceedings behind the currency of payment specified in the contract will be enacted.

### Treasury management

A monthly statement of our treasury balance and transactions will be made available in our repo [amaru-treasury](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/tree/main) including:
> Every transaction made in the month  
> A recap for each scope of amount spent in the month 

## Consequence

- Each contracted work done on the project will be available in the [amaru-treasury Journal](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru-treasury/tree/main/journal) in a transparent manner so that everyone is aware of what's ongoing.

- We will try to keep things as simple as they can be while keeping up a structured management environement.
