# Amaru maintainers committee for 2026

## Context

The [previously appointed](./005-amaru-maintainers-committee.md) maintainer committee is updated for 2026 following Amaru's latest budget and scope division.

## Decision

The new composition of the Amaru maintainers committee, and their respective scopes of work, for 2026 (scope owners of the project) is:

| <img src="https://github.com/ktorz.png" width=50 height=50 alt="KtorZ" /> <br/> <pre>Matthias Benkort</pre> <br/> [@KtorZ][] | <img src="https://github.com/paolino.png" width=50 height=50 alt="Paolino" /> <br/> <pre>Paolo Veronelli</pre> <br/> [@paolino][] | <img src="https://github.com/quantumplation.png" width=50 height=50 alt="Quantumplation"/> <br/> <pre>Pi Lanningham</pre> <br/> [@Quantumplation][] | <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161828179?v=4" width=50 height=50 alt="Dam-CZ" /> <br/> <pre>Damien Czapla</pre> <br/> [@Dam-CZ][]  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Development | Network compliance & Cardano level Testing | Middleware integrations | Operations & Use Cases |

[@KtorZ]: https://github.com/ktorz
[@paolino]: https://github.com/paolino
[@Quantumplation]: https://github.com/Quantumplation
[@Dam-CZ]: https://github.com/Dam-CZ

As lead maintainer, [Matthias Benkort - @KtorZ](https://github.com/KtorZ) (still) provides the ultimate voice in decision-making regarding final integration and architectural designs.

## Consequences

- Each committee member shall own a budget pertaining to its scope, and administrate that budget over the course of the year alongside other members of the committee.
- The composition of the [Amaru Maintainers Committee](https://github.com/orgs/pragma-org/teams/amaru-maintainers-committee) Github team shall be amended accordingly.
- The rights, powers and obligations of the (not renewed) members of the previous committee are no longer.
